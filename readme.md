# MVC Application in PHP

This is a PHP web application that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The application focuses on an online store and offers features such as real-time search, category filtering, and product details display.

## Directory Structure

The application follows a directory structure that clearly separates the MVC components:

- `lib/`: Contains the models that interact with the database and manage the application's data.

- `views/`: Contains the views responsible for presentation and the user interface.

- `main/`: Contains the controllers that handle user requests and coordinate the application's logic.

- `public/`: Stores static resources such as stylesheets, images, and JavaScript files.

- `config/`: Contains configuration files for the database and other important settings.
